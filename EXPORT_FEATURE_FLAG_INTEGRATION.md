# Export Data Feature Flag Integration - 'ee'

## Overview
Successfully integrated feature flag with key `"ee"` to control visibility of the Export Data feature in the PresuSimple app, and removed the Generate Report button from the Reports screen.

## Feature Flag Key
- **Key**: `ee`
- **Location**: Defined in [src/types/featureFlags.ts](src/types/featureFlags.ts)
- **Default**: `false` (Export Data hidden by default)

## Changes Made

### 1. Export Data Button (Reports Screen)
**Location**: [app/(tabs)/reports.tsx](app/(tabs)/reports.tsx)

**What it controls**:
- Shows/hides the entire "Actions" section containing the Export Data button
- Allows users to export their budget data when enabled

**Implementation**:
- Added `useFeatureFlags` hook to check the 'ee' flag
- Conditionally renders the Actions section with Export Data button (lines 210-218)
- The entire Actions section only appears when `ee = true`

**Behavior**:
- When `ee = false`: No Actions section visible on Reports screen
- When `ee = true`: Actions section visible with Export Data button

### 2. Generate Report Button - REMOVED
**Location**: [app/(tabs)/reports.tsx](app/(tabs)/reports.tsx)

**What was removed**:
- Completely removed the "Generate Report" button
- Removed the `handleGenerateReport` function
- The Generate Report feature is no longer available in the app

**Reason for removal**:
- Feature was not implemented (showed placeholder alert)
- Simplified the UI by focusing only on Export Data functionality

### 3. Settings Screen
**Location**: [app/(tabs)/settings.tsx](app/(tabs)/settings.tsx)

**Status**: Export Data button already commented out (line 250-262)
- No changes needed
- Button was previously disabled

## Files Modified

1. **[src/types/featureFlags.ts](src/types/featureFlags.ts)**
   - Added `EE: 'ee'` to `FEATURE_FLAG_KEYS` (line 57)
   - Updated comment to clarify it's the "Export data flag"

2. **[app/(tabs)/reports.tsx](app/(tabs)/reports.tsx)**
   - Added `useFeatureFlags` and `FEATURE_FLAG_KEYS` imports
   - Added `isExportEnabled` check using the 'ee' flag
   - Wrapped Actions section in conditional `{isExportEnabled && ...}`
   - Removed `handleGenerateReport` function
   - Removed Generate Report button completely

## How to Use

### Enable Export Data Feature
Set the feature flag `ee` to `true` on your backend/API:

```javascript
{
  "features": {
    "ee": true
  }
}
```

### Disable Export Data Feature
Set the feature flag `ee` to `false` on your backend/API:

```javascript
{
  "features": {
    "ee": false
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Export Data Disabled (ee = false)
1. Set `ee` flag to `false` in your feature flag service
2. Navigate to Reports screen
3. **Expected**: No "Actions" section visible
4. **Expected**: Only see statistics and charts

### Test Case 2: Export Data Enabled (ee = true)
1. Set `ee` flag to `true` in your feature flag service
2. Navigate to Reports screen
3. **Expected**: "Actions" section visible at bottom of screen
4. **Expected**: See "Export Data" button with download icon
5. Click "Export Data" button
6. **Expected**: See alert showing feature coming soon message

## Benefits

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Enable export feature for specific users or regions
2. **Beta Testing**: Test export functionality with beta users first
3. **Emergency Kill Switch**: Quickly disable if export issues arise
4. **Feature Maturity**: Launch export when fully implemented
5. **Cleaner UI**: Removed incomplete Generate Report feature

## UI Changes

### Before
- Reports screen had two buttons:
  - Export Data
  - Generate Report (placeholder/not implemented)

### After
- Reports screen conditionally shows:
  - Export Data button (only when `ee = true`)
  - No Generate Report button (completely removed)

## Related Code

- **Reports Screen**: [app/(tabs)/reports.tsx](app/(tabs)/reports.tsx)
- **Settings Screen**: [app/(tabs)/settings.tsx](app/(tabs)/settings.tsx) (Export already commented out)
- **Feature Flag Types**: [src/types/featureFlags.ts](src/types/featureFlags.ts)
- **Feature Flag Hook**: [src/hooks/useFeatureFlags.ts](src/hooks/useFeatureFlags.ts)

## Notes

- The 'ee' flag controls **visibility** of the Export Data button only
- Export Data functionality is not yet implemented (shows placeholder alert)
- When the export feature is fully implemented, update `handleExportData` function
- Generate Report button has been permanently removed from the codebase
- Default fallback is `false` (Export Data hidden) for safety

## Future Implementation

When Export Data feature is ready:

1. Implement actual export functionality in `handleExportData`
2. Consider export formats (CSV, JSON, PDF, etc.)
3. Add file sharing/download capabilities
4. Update alert message to actual export flow
5. Keep feature flag to control rollout
