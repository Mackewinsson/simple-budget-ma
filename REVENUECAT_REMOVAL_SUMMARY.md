# RevenueCat Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all RevenueCat integration from the PresuSimple app as in-app purchases are not being implemented at this time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies
- **Removed**: `react-native-purchases@^9.5.4` from [package.json](package.json)
- Ran `npm uninstall react-native-purchases` to clean up dependencies

### 2. Environment Variables
- Removed `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS` from:
  - [.env.development](.env.development)
  - [.env.production](.env.production)
  - [app.config.ts](app.config.ts) extra configuration

### 3. Deleted Files
- `src/lib/revenueCat.ts` - RevenueCat service and configuration
- `src/hooks/useRevenueCat.ts` - RevenueCat React hook
- `components/RevenueCatProvider.tsx` - RevenueCat provider component
- `components/UpgradeModal.tsx` - Subscription upgrade modal
- `src/store/subscriptionStore.ts` - Subscription state management
- `app/test-subscription.tsx` - Subscription testing page
- `app/upgrade.tsx` - Upgrade page

### 4. Updated Files

#### [app/_layout.tsx](app/_layout.tsx)
- Removed `RevenueCatProvider` wrapper
- Removed `UpgradeModal` component
- Removed upgrade route from Stack navigation

#### [src/hooks/useFeatureAccess.ts](src/hooks/useFeatureAccess.ts)
- Removed `useRevenueCat` hook dependency
- Removed `useSubscriptionStore` dependency
- Removed RevenueCat pro access checks
- Simplified `showUpgradeModal` to only log (no modal shown)
- Feature access now based only on:
  - Feature flags
  - Legacy user plan (`session.user.plan === "pro"`)
  - Legacy paid status (`session.user.isPaid`)

#### [PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md](PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Removed all RevenueCat setup steps
- Removed IAP (In-App Purchase) references
- Removed product ID configurations
- Removed entitlement configurations
- Simplified testing checklist
- Removed RevenueCat documentation links

## Feature Access After Removal

Users can still access premium features through:

1. **Feature Flags**: Server-controlled feature flags via the backend API
2. **Legacy Plan Check**: Users with `plan: "pro"` in their session
3. **Legacy Paid Status**: Users with `isPaid: true` in their session

## What This Means

- ❌ **No In-App Purchases**: Users cannot purchase subscriptions through the app
- ❌ **No RevenueCat Integration**: All RevenueCat code and dependencies removed
- ✅ **Feature Flags Still Work**: Premium features can still be enabled via backend
- ✅ **Simpler Codebase**: Reduced complexity and dependencies
- ✅ **Faster Builds**: One less native module to compile

## If You Want to Re-add IAP Later

To re-add in-app purchases in the future:

1. Install RevenueCat package:
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-purchases
   ```

2. Restore the deleted files from git history:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/lib/revenueCat.ts
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/hooks/useRevenueCat.ts
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- components/RevenueCatProvider.tsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- components/UpgradeModal.tsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/store/subscriptionStore.ts
   ```

3. Add RevenueCat API key back to environment files

4. Re-integrate the provider in app/_layout.tsx

5. Update product IDs to match presusimple.com domain
